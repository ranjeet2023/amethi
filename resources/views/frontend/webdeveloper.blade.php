                                </b><br>A web developer’s job is to create websites. While their primary role is to ensure
                                the website is visually appealing and easy to navigate, many web developers are also
                                responsible for the website’s performance and capacity.

                                </b> <br>Web developers usually fall under one of three categories: back-end developers,
                                front-end developers, and full-stack developers. Some web developers also work as
                                webmasters. Let’s take a closer look at each of these roles.

                                    visitors see and interact with (also known as the user interface). They design the
                                    physical layout of each page, integrate graphics, and use HTML and JavaScript to enhance
                                    the site.

                                    others who need to manage a website’s content.

                                    These developers have the knowledge to build a complete website and may work for
                                    organizations that don’t have the budget for a large website team.

                                science, but others teach themselves how to code and design websites. While earning a degree
                                can make you a more competitive candidate, a strong portfolio can go a long way toward

                                            Web developers often run into issues when designing websites. They should have
                                            the patience and ability to identify problems in the design or coding and solve
                                            them in a methodical way.</p>

                                    <p>While you don’t always need a degree to get a job in web development, it can
                                        certainly help. If you’re already in school (or considering earning a degree), some
                                        majors might be a better fit for your career goals than others. If you’re more
                                        interested in back-end web development, consider a degree program in computer
                                        science</p>

                                    <p>You don’t necessarily need formal training to work as a web developer. It’s possible
                                        to acquire the skills you need on your own. For example, you can take a course to
                                        learn programming languages like HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, and then put what you
                                        learn into practice on your own website.</p>

                                        resume. This collection of projects shows potential employers what you’re capable of
                                        creating. Include the types of projects that represent the work you’d like to do. If
                                        you’re including code, be sure to annotate it to show your thought process.</p>

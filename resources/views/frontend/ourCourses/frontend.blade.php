                                <b><h2>What Does a Front-End Developer Do? </h2></b><br>A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites
                                and web applications—the part users see and interact with.
                                A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML,
                                 CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app.
                                When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer.

                                <br>
                                Front-end developers create user interfaces (UI). UI is the graphical layout of an application
                                that determines what each part of a site or application does and how it will look. "I've always
                                found crafting polished user interactions that surprise and delight users to be the most rewarding
                                 and engaging task," says Mari Batilando, a software engineer at Meta. "In order to do this, you need to both have an
                                 eye for detail and a rock-solid understanding of the platform."

                                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and applications on the World Wide Web. It serves as the backbone of every webpage, providing the structure and content organization.
                                    <br>
                                    In simple terms, HTML is a set of tags or elements that define the structure and layout of a webpage. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and are used to mark up different parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, forms, and more.
                                    <br>
                                    HTML allows you to structure your content hierarchically, with elements nested inside other elements. It provides semantic meaning to the content, making it accessible to both humans and search engines.
                                    <br>
                                    When a web browser reads an HTML document, it interprets the tags and renders the content accordingly. This means that HTML determines how the content is displayed on the screen, including the text formatting, images, and interactive elements.
                                    <br>
                                    To create a web page, you write HTML code using a text editor and save the file with a .html extension. This HTML file can then be opened in a web browser to view the rendered webpage.
                                    <br>
                                    HTML is a fundamental skill for anyone interested in web development. It serves as the starting point for building web pages and lays the foundation for more advanced technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript.

                                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and visual appearance of a document written in HTML or XML. It is a fundamental technology in web development that allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a webpage.
                                <br>
                                    In simple terms, CSS acts as a separate layer from the HTML structure and provides a way to style and design web content. It works by targeting HTML elements and applying various styles and properties to them.
                                <br>
                                    With CSS, you can define how elements should be displayed on the screen, including their size, position, margins, padding, and border. You can also specify the colors, fonts, background images, and other visual effects to create an attractive and consistent user interface.
                                <br>
                                    One of the key features of CSS is its cascading nature, which allows you to apply styles to multiple elements at once and define specific styles for individual elements. CSS rules are written in a hierarchical manner, and when multiple styles are applied to the same element, the cascading rules determine which style takes precedence.
                                <br>
                                    CSS can be written directly within an HTML file using inline styles, embedded within the style  tags in the head section, or linked externally from a separate CSS file. External CSS files are preferred for larger projects as they promote better organization and reusability of styles across multiple webpages.
                                <br>
                                    By learning CSS, you gain the ability to enhance the visual appeal of your web pages, create responsive layouts, and ensure a consistent design across your website. CSS is an essential skill for web designers and developers to bring life and creativity to their HTML content.

                                    Client-side scripting: JavaScript is primarily used on the client-side, meaning it runs in the user's web browser. It allows you to manipulate HTML elements, handle events, validate forms, create animations, and perform various other interactive tasks.
                                    <br>
                                        Scripting language: JavaScript is often referred to as a scripting language because it is typically embedded within HTML pages and executed on-demand by the web browser. It doesn't require a separate compilation step.
                                    <br>

                                        Object-oriented programming (OOP): JavaScript supports object-oriented programming concepts like objects, classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. It provides a flexible and dynamic approach to building complex applications.
                                    <br>

                                        Cross-platform compatibility: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a widely compatible language. This allows you to create web applications that work consistently across different browsers and operating systems.
                                    <br>

                                        Integration with HTML and CSS: JavaScript can interact with HTML elements and modify their content, attributes, and styles. It can also manipulate CSS classes and dynamically apply styles to elements, enabling dynamic and responsive web design.
                                    <br>

                                        Extensibility through libraries and frameworks: JavaScript has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which provide powerful tools and abstractions for building complex web applications with ease.
                                    <br>

                                        Server-side scripting: JavaScript is not limited to client-side development. With the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript can now be used for server-side scripting as well. This allows developers to build end-to-end web applications using a single programming language.
                                    <br>

                                        JavaScript is a versatile language that continues to evolve with new features and capabilities. It offers a wide range of possibilities for creating interactive web experiences and has become an essential skill for web developers.
